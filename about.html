        <p> Hello, <strong><em>my name is Adhithya</em></strong> and I am currently in my 3rd year of Electrical Engineering Bachelor's degree at Rajalakshmi Engineering College. I have a strong passion for Electrical Engineering and all of its subjects. I find great satisfaction in delving deep into the concepts and sharing my knowledge with others.

      In addition to my studies, I am also skilled in video editing using <strong>Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Blender 3D</strong>. I believe that my skills in video editing can be a valuable asset for teaching.

      I am always eager to learn new things and apply my knowledge in creative ways. I am excited to see where my passion for Electrical Engineering will take me in the future and I am confident that it will lead me to a fulfilling career.

      Thank you for visiting <em>my website</em> and I look forward to connecting with you!
